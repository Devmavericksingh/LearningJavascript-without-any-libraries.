# LearningJavascript-without-any-libraries.
<h1>No libraries just complete javascript.</h1>

<h1>Why learn it again?</h1>

Because I made the stupid mistake of not learning Javascript vanilla. 
It resulted in me relying too much googling, even the most basic stuff. 
Re-learning it must be done along with working to really reach an elite level. 
Re-learning must be done properly this time.


<h1>The How?</h1>

1. First make sure you understand what every line of javascript does. Each and every line. Think slow to learn faster and better.
2. Read and Write code. Previously, all I did was write code and not read top quality code. This time read high quality code. Google, "Best Javascript examples", or something along that line and read a little everyday. Try the code you read yourself and fuck around with it a little.
3. Start with the book Eloquent Javascript. 
4. After finishing Eloquent Javascript browse the contents of Beginning Javascript and You don't know JS series. If you missed out on any concepts go ahead and learn them too.
5. Move over to Professional Javascript for Web developers.
6. Now comes the important part which will help correct your previous mistakes. Do not forget what you just learned. Follow the forgetting curve even during what comes next.
7. FreeCodeCamp. Complete the Javascript track. 
8. Now make sure you keep revising the old stuff as you complete rest of freecodecamp. 

<h1>Avoid the following mistakes</h1>

Do not even touch a framework until you have done a lot of dense raw Javascript programming.
Use the forgetting curve wisely. Any concept that needs more attention should be noted in ANKI.
Make pro bono website for that vet only after you have done it right. Your previous mistakes were why you were not able to create you vision of his website. It was going to be beautiful. The concept for unique but you fucked up. It took way to long because of how you learned programming last time. Don't half ass it you fuck.
